## _Heart Attack Prediction Project_

# _Overview_
This end-to-end project aims to predict the probability of a heart attack based on a patientâ€™s medical analysis data. The project involves data integration, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and validation. A user interface was developed using Python Streamlit, allowing medical staff to interact with the deployed model via API calls.

***Data***
The dataset was sourced from public medical data repositories and includes the following independent variables:

Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Sex of the patient
CP: Chest Pain Type
Trestbps: Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
Chol: Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
FBS: Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl
Restecg: Resting Electrocardiographic Results
Thalach: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
Exang: Exercise Induced Angina
Oldpeak: ST Depression Induced by Exercise
Slope: Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
CA: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
Thal: Thalassemia

</br>

## _`Process`_
Data Integration: Pulled and integrated data from public medical sources.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand data patterns and relationships.
Model Building: Developed predictive models to estimate heart attack probability.
Model Evaluation & Validation: Evaluated and validated models to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Deployment: Deployed the validated model using a Streamlit interface for real-time predictions.
</br>
## _`User Interface`_
Developed a user-friendly interface with Streamlit where medical staff can input patient data and receive predictions from the model in real-time.

</br>

## _`Usage`_
Medical professionals can use the interface to input patient medical data and obtain predictions on the likelihood of a heart attack, aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.
